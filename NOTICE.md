## Privacy Policy

TabSINT is a platform for configuring and administering hearing-related exams, as well as general-purpose questionnaires. As a flexible platform, TabSINT may be configured to automatically collect many types of data, including images, audio, and tablet location. This data can be uploaded to a back end data repository only if configured by a TabSINT Administrator. The TabSINT administrator is responsible for configuring the application, developing and testing the protocol, and managing test results. Data is never transferred outside the application unless configured by the TabSINT administrator, or if TabSINT is configured to upload application logs for debugging purposes.

### Logging

The TabSINT application includes a setting to upload application loags to private server to help debug remote issues. By default, this setting is disabled.  If this setting is enabled, the application may record device state, location, network status, or test results in the application log and upload this data to our server. Please ensure logging is set to the desired state before using the application. 

If you have questions regarding these policies, please contact tabsint@creare.com.
