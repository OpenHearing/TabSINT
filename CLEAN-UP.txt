  - all the css in src/styles.scss
- look for "TODO" in code base for notes
- remove / modify all console.log statements
- replace any with more descriptive typings
- search for any "ng-" and update
- try to use '() => {}' instead of 'function() {}' when defining functions
- angular.isDefined() replace with !_.isUndefined()
- clean up all comments, both '//' and '*/ blah /*'
