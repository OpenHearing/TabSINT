Things that have been added to get tabsint up and running but we could revisit

- style sheets
  - jsonformatter@0.7.0
  - ionicons@2.0.1
  - all the css in src/styles.scss
- look for "TODO" in code base for notes
- remove / modify all console.log statements
- replace 'any' with more descriptive typings
- search for any "ng-" and remove/replace it
- try to use '() => {}' instead of 'function() {}' when defining functions
- angular.isDefined() replace with !_.isUndefined()
- clean up all comments, both '//' and '*/ blah /*' and replace with descriptive function names
- create the response area interfaces programmatically from the JSON schema using 
https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-schema-to-typescript
- UI related functionality should live in components and not services
- avoid deeply nested functions (soft rule of <3)
- styles: 
  * we use ; at end of lines
  * space after :, spaces for if loops (i.e. if (condition) {})
