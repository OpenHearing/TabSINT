## Documentation

We are currently planning to use TS Docs. This will look something like the following example. Note that if you hover over the example in VS Code or other IDE's this will provide you with information about the function.

/**
    * Example of TS Doc
    *
    * @remarks can put remarks here
    * @param x description of variable x
    * @returns what the function returns
    * @customExpression can define anything like this as well
*/
ExampleFunction(x:string) {
    // does something
    return something
}
