TabSINT is an open source platform for administering tablet based hearing-related exams, as well as general-purpose questionnaires. It is meant to be flexible, easy-to-use, and useful for administrators who manage studies of all sizes.
Exams and questionnaires are presented as a series of pages using a crisp and intuitive interface. Results are uploaded to a central server or saved locally on the tablet.
