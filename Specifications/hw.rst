Threshold Determination
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Edit or remove this section?

The fundamental stimulus of the Hughson-Westlake algorithm is a sequence of short tone presentations referred to as a pulse train (:ref:`Pulse Train <hw_figure_1>`).  Following the last tone of the pulse train there is a period of silence referred to as the inter-stimulus interval (ISI).  The *level* of the next pulse train is calculated based on whether or not the subject responds.  The ISI is randomly selected based on a uniform distribution between **MinISI** and **MaxISI** milliseconds.

The presentation *level* logic is shown in the flowchart below (:ref:`Flowchart <hw_figure_2>`).  Starting *level* may be selectable by the user. All increments and decrements to *level* may be derived from a single parameter, **StepSize**.  The **StepSize** defines the smallest change in *level* during the entire algorithm.

Polling time: patient response is polled from the onset of the pulse train stimulus, until a Polling Offset period has elapsed beyond the last tone in the pulse train.  After the subjectâ€™s first response, the ISI should be modified by adding a random pause that can vary between a minimum of the PollingOffset time and a maximum of 3 seconds :ref:`See Note <isi-note>`.  This is done to ensure the subject does not simply press the button at regular intervals.

Patient responses received during the polling time are considered valid and should be used when evaluating the *Response?* conditional statements in the :ref:`flowchart <hw_figure_2>`.  If a response is received outside the polling time, it is considered a **FalsePositive** (see `TestHughsonWestlakeResults`_).  Upon receiving a valid response, the algorithm should immediately proceed to the end of the **PulseTrain** (ramping down the tone if necessary).  The **PollingOffset** will remain (meaning there will still be a minimum of the **MinISI** before the beginning of the next **PulseTrain**).  However, responses received during this **PollingOffset** period that follow valid responses should be ignored (i.e., neither counted as **FalsePositives** nor considered valid responses; this could occur if someone taps a button twice in response to a **PulseTrain**).  

The response time to each presentation should be recorded in test results (see `TestHughsonWestlakeResults`_). The response time is measured as the time between the onset of the pulse train and when the response is registered by the headset in milliseconds. The response time should be measured and recorded even if it is outside the **PollingOffset** during the inter-stimulus interval. If the user does not provide a response before the onset of the next pulse train, the response time should be recorded in the array as 0.

If *SemiAutomaticMode* is True, the exam pauses after each pulse train, the *PollingOffset* is ignored, and the CHA waits for an answer on whether the patient heard the pulse train or not. When an answer is received the exam resumes.

.. _polling_offset-note:

.. note::
   We may wish to consider adding a parameter in the future called Polling Ignore (not shown, not currently implemented on CHA).  This parameter would specify a duration at the start of each pulse train during which patient responses are ignored because they occur too soon to be valid.

.. _falsepositive-note:

.. note::
   In the future, we may define some logic that would halt the algorithm based on number of **FalsePositive** responses. Lots of **FalsePositives** may indicate the patient either did not understand or is unable to follow the directions.

.. _hw-threshold-determination:

As described in section 3.5.3.3 of the [NhanesAudiometryManual]_, the "threshold is defined as the lowest intensity at which the tone has been heard by the examinee".  50% of all *ascending presentations* must agree (minimum 2 in agreement).  Note that the first time a subject responds, which may occur on the first or subsequent presentations, should be discarded and not counted as a response to an *ascending presentation.* The reason is that the starting level is intended to be significantly above the subject's threshold and this initial response just alerts the subject to the fact a test has started.  

Following a test, results should show each presentation *level* versus presentation number.

:ref:`Examples of Hughson-Westlake Responses <hw_figure_3>` show threshold calculation according to the 50 percent of responses logic.

.. _isi-note:

.. note::
   The inter-stimulus interval (ISI) cannot be less than Polling Offset.

   *Example Presentation with Two Pulse Trains*

AB is the ramp rise time, AD is the tone duration, CD is the ramp fall time, and AE is the tone repetition interval. Polling Offset is the time after the end of the pulse train during which the patient response is still polled. The inter stimulus interval is the time between the end of one pulse train and the beginning of another.  It has a variable random length except for the first few presentations.

Threshold Verification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. todo::
   Edit, rename, or remove this section?

In some cases, thresholds only need to be verified, not determined.  This screener variation of the Hughson-Westlake audiometry exam is intended to check that the patient has at least a specified threshold or better (lower), without taking as much time as the standard exam.

The logic for the screener is shown in the flowchart below (:ref:`Screener Flowchart <hw-level-screener-flowchart>`).  It is like the threshold determination version, except: 

1. The level does not change (**StepSize** = 0)
2. The protocol specifies the number of correct presentations required (**NumCorrectReq**) to consider "pass" and the maximum number of presentations (**PresentationMax**), instead of 2-for-3
3. The result includes the number of correct responses (**NumCorrectResp**)
4. **ResultType** is interpreted differently, with "Threshold" meaning "Pass" and "Failed to Converge" meaning "Fail".

Use of the screener version is indicated with the boolean **Screener** as an input parameter in TestHughsonWestlake.  When this input is True, the screener algorithm is used, and that includes slightly different definitions/uses of some of the input (HughsonWestlakeTest) and output (HughsonWestlakeResult) parameters, discussed above.

This class is returned from ProbeLink::getTestResults upon successful test completion.  In the event the maximum number of presentations is exceeded, both the Threshold and MaximumExcursion will be undefined and should be returned as not-a-number (NaN).  The array of presentation levels, L, should be initialized to NaNs.  This array should then be populated with the levels presented to the subject.  At the conclusion of a test, this array of levels should be returned regardless of whether the test is successful or not â€“ this array of levels may be useful for post-analysis even if the subject fails to reach a Threshold.

.. rubric:: *Notes*
..  [2] These units should match the |lu| requested. See :ref:`TestAudiometry`
..  [3] The response time of interest from a clinical perspective is from (2) to (4) in the figure below. The **ResponseTime** result, however, includes a latency that is due to the tablet OS, hardware, and Bluetooth radio [steps (4) to (6) in the figure below]. For the Samsung Tab-E tablet, this latency is ``250 +/- 50 ms``. **ResponseTime** should be referenced only when the tablet hardware is characterized and controlled throughout data collection. See IM-21-11-201 for a summary of timing studies.

        When setting and discussing **PollingOffset** with collaborators, it is important to consider this latency. As an example, setting **PollingOffset** to ``600 ms`` means response times at (4) that are greater than ``350 ms`` (``600 - 250``) after the pulse train would be characterized as **FalsePositive**. This is likely not intuitive. As a simple rule of thumb, add ``300 ms`` (``average latency + one standard deviation``) to the clinically desired response time.

           The **ResponseTime** result returned from the CHA is from (2) to (6). The response time of interest from a clinical perspective is from (2) to (4).

        It is also important to consider how the length of the ISI relative to the stimulis and polling offset. As shown below, the time when a response is accepted versus rejected can be highly weighted toward *accept* when the ISI is short relative to the stimulus and polling offset.

           :align: center

           The length of the ISI should be considered carefully with respect to the length of the stimulus and polling offset.
