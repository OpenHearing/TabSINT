Requirement,Test Case,Acceptance,Verified
"The exam presents tones with a specified starting frequency, level, and output channel.",Start a Manual Audiometry exam by playing a tone.,"Verify that the emitted tone is the correct level, frequency and output channel.",
The user can increase the signal level.,Adjust the tone level up.,Verify that the tones increased by the specified level.,
The user can decrease the signal level.,Adjust the tone level down.,Verify that the tones decreased by the specified level.,
The user can increase the signal frequency.,Adjust the frequency up.,Verify that the frequency increased by the specified level.,
The user can decrease the signal frequency.,Adjust the frequency down.,Verify that the frequency decreased by the specified level.,
The exam cannot play a tone above the maximum output level.,Determine the headset's **MaximumOutputLevel** at 3 different frequencies. Attempt to adjust the sound level above the **MaximumOutputLevel** at each frequency.,Verify that the headset does not allow a tone to be played above the **MaximumOutputLevel** at each frequency.,
The exam cannot play a tone below the minimum output level.,Attempt to adjust the sound level below the **MinimumOutputLevel** (-10 dB HL) at three different frequencies.,Verify that the headset does not allow a tone to be played below the **MinimumOutputLevel** at each frequency.,
"Narrow-band masking noise of the type specified in Section 6.3 and 7.4 of [AnsiAudiometerSpec2018]_ should be used, where the geometric center frequency coincides with that of the test tone and the bandwidth of the noise is one-third of an octave.",Adjust the masker level so that masking noise is presented. Stop the masker and confirm it is stopped.,Analyze the waveform and verify that the masking noise has a center frequency that coincides with that of the test tone and the bandwidth of the noise is one-third of an octave.,
The user can change the output channel.,Change the output channel.,Verify that the tones are emitted from the new output channel.,
