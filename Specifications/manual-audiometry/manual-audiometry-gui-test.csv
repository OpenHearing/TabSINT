Attempt to adjust the sound level above the **MaximumOutputLevel** at each frequency.,Verify that the headset does not allow a tone to be played above the **MaximumOutputLevel** at each frequency. The device will notify the user with an error.,
The exam cannot play a tone below the minimum output level (- 10 dB HL). ,Attempt to adjust the sound level below the **MinimumOutputLevel** (-10 dB HL) at two different frequencies.,Verify that the headset does not allow a tone to be played below -10 dB HL at each frequency. Audhere only: The device will notify the user with an error.,
The exam must allow the user to control when the masking noise is played.,Navigate to the start page and start the masking noise.  Play a few tones and then stop the masking noise.,"Verify that when the masking noise button is pressed, the masking noise begins.

By confirming, you acknowledge the risk of presenting potentially hazardous tones to the subject.``",
The user can continuously scroll through the frequencies. ,"On the Manual Audiometry dashboard, scroll through the fequencies using the right and left buttons.","Verify that you can access all the frequencies. Pressing the right arrow from the highest frequency will bring you back to the lowest frequency. Likewise, pressing the left arrow from the lowest frequency will bring you back to the highest frequency.  The test frequency should not auto-proceed.",
The user can change test ear.,"On the Manual Audiometry dashboard, change the test ear.",Verify that the tones are played from the requested ear.,
